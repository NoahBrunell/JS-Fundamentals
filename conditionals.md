# Conditionals

In JavaScript, **conditions** are used to control the flow of a program. The **"if"** statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is **true**. If the condition is false, the program moves on to the next block of code. The **"else"** statement is used in with "if" to execute a different block of code if the condition is **false**. This allows the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

The **"switch"** statement is an alternative to using multiple "if" statements. It allows the program to compare a **variable** to multiple values and execute a block of code based on which value matches. Each value is represented by a **"case"** statement, and the block of code to execute is placed after the colon. The **"break"** keyword is used to exit the switch statement and prevent the program from executing the other cases.

# Example
```
if (condition == true) {
    // Do stuff
} else {
    // Do some other stuff
}
```
