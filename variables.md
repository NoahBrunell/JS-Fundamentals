# Variables

In JavaScript, variables are used to store values that can be used later in a program. They are declared using **"let", or "const"** keyword, followed by the name of the variable. Variables can hold diffrent data types, including **numbers, strings, objects, and booleans**. JavaScript also allows variables to be dynamically typed, which means that the same variable can hold different types of data at different places in the program. This flexibility makes JavaScript an good language for building **dynamic and interactive** web applications.

#Example

```
const name = Noah

console.log(name) // Output: Noah
```
