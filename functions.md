# Functions

A JavaScript **function** is a block of code designed to perform a specific task, and it can be **called and executed** multiple times throughout the program.

# Example
```
function greeting(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Calling the function
var result = greeting("John");
console.log(result); // Output: "Hello, John!"
```

In this example, the function "greeting" can be called multiple times with different names as **arguments**, and it will return a personalized greeting for each one.
